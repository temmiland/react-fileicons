# react-fileicons - [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-fileicons.svg?color=%2345bf17&style=popout)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-fileicons) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tomxpcvx/react-fileicons.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tomxpcvx/react-fileicons)

react-fileicons is a simple and intuitive react component for visualizing file icons.

## Demo

You can reach the Storybook [here](https://tomxpcvx.github.io/react-fileicons/).

## Usage

First you should import the needed files.

```
import FileIcon, { ColorSchema } from 'react-fileicons';
```

After that you can use the FileIcon component. 
To change the color of the component, you can use the built-in color list ```ColorScheme```. 

```
<FileIcon extension="doc" colorScheme={ColorScheme.red} />
```

Alternatively, you can use your own color configurations. However, these must be in the following format.

```
<FileIcon extension="doc" colorScheme={{primary: '#1E88E5', secondary: '#1976D2'}} />
```

The following options can be used to access different designs:

```
<FileIcon
    extension="doc"                 # only the first 5 characters are displayed
    colorScheme={ColorScheme.red}   # must be in the above format
    linearGradient                  # switches the component to the gradient design   
    outline                         # switches the component to the outline design   
    small                           # activates the small design   
    medium                          # activates the medium design   
/>
```

Properties of the designs should only be used in the combination size and type. 
If you use ```small``` and ```medium``` at the same time, ```medium``` overwrites ```small```. 
If you use ```outline``` and ```linearGradient``` at the same time, ```outline``` overwrites ```linearGradient```.
